# RGBD_OakCamera_RTABMap-
This repository provides a synchronized stereo matching pipeline using the OAK-D Pro camera, generating RGB-D images with disparity-based depth and integrated IMU data. The output is fully compatible with RTAB-Map for real-time 3D reconstruction, SLAM, and visual-inertial mapping applications.
